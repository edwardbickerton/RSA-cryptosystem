# RSA-cryptosystem  
  
## WARNING:  
I made this mainly for my own education. I'm not a proffessional coder (at the time of writing at least) or anything and I don't study computer science. So I wouldn't use this for anything serious. Check out my blogpost on the RSA cryptosystem http://satsuma.blog/html/blog_posts/RSA_cryptosystem.html  
  
## Installation:  
1. Download the three .py files. Click the green button "Code" and click "Download ZIP".  
2. Use py2app to make an application from the .py files

3. Send me an encrypted message :)
  
Alternatively just run the rsa_gui.py file.
