# RSA-cryptosystem

![RSA_screenshot](RSA_screenshot.png)

## WARNING:

I made this mainly for my own education. I'm not a proffessional coder (at the time of writing at least) or anything and I don't study computer science. So I wouldn't use this for anything serious. Check out my blogpost on the RSA cryptosystem http://Satsuma-LN.github.io/html/blog_posts/RSA_cryptosystem.html

## Installation:

1. Download the .py file. Click the green button "Code" and click "Download ZIP".
2. Use py2app to make an application from the .py files  
   https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html
3. Send me an encrypted message :)

Alternatively just run the rsa.py file.
